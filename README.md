# Data Analyst Salary Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Data Analyst job postings collected from Glassdoor. The analysis includes data cleaning, salary calculation, and insightful visualizations. The project also features an interactive Power BI dashboard for a better understanding of the data.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The dataset includes around 2,000 job postings for Data Analyst roles. The analysis covers the following key aspects:
